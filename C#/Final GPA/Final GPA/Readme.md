# GPA Calculator Application
## Introduction
This project is a simple GPA (Grade Point Average) calculator application developed in C#. The purpose of this application is to demonstrate fundamental programming skills, including variable declaration, data manipulation, and data presentation in the context of a GPA calculation scenario.

## Project Overview
The GPA calculator application does the following:

1. Variable Declaration: It declares and initializes variables to store student information, course names, credits, and grades.

2. Calculating Total Credit Hours and Grade Points: The application calculates the total credit hours and grade points earned by the student based on the provided course data.

3. Calculating the GPA: Using the formula totalGradePoints / totalCreditHours, it calculates the GPA. The GPA is then converted into a decimal with leading and trailing digits.

4. Formatting and Displaying Results: It utilizes the Console.WriteLine() method and escape characters to format and display results. The application presents student information, course details, and the final GPA.

## Code Overview
Here's a brief overview of the key code sections:

- Variable Declaration (Section 2 Code): This section declares and initializes variables for student and course information.

- Calculating Total Credit Hours and Grade Points (Section 3 Code): These calculations are crucial for determining the GPA.

- Calculating the GPA (Section 4 Code): The GPA calculation is performed, and the result is formatted with leading and trailing digits.

- Formatting and Displaying Results (Section 5 Code): This section uses Console.WriteLine() to present the student's information, course details, and final GPA.

## How to Use
To use the GPA calculator application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build and run the project.
4. The application will display the student's information and the calculated GPA.

## Future Enhancements
This project serves as a starting point for further development. Future enhancements could include:

- Implementing a user interface for inputting course details.
- Supporting different grading systems (e.g., letter grades).
- Saving and loading data from external files.
## Conclusion
This GPA calculator application is a practical example of fundamental coding skills in C#. It demonstrates variable usage, numerical calculations, and data presentation. Feel free to explore and expand upon this project as you continue your programming journey.
