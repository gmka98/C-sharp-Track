# Student GPA Calculator
## Prepare the Guided Project
### Project Overview
You will be using the .NET editor as your code development environment. You will write code that uses string and numeric variables, perform calculations, and then format and display the results in a console.

### Project Scope
You are developing a Student GPA (Grade Point Average) calculator. The parameters for your application are as follows:

Student name and class information will be provided to you.
Each class will have a name, the student's grade, and the corresponding credit hours.
Your application should perform basic mathematical operations to calculate the student's GPA.

Your application should generate/display the student's name, class information, and the GPA.

### Project Goals
Your application should achieve the following objectives:

Perform basic mathematical operations to calculate the student's GPA using the provided class information.

Generate and display the results in the console. The results should include the student's name, information for each class (name, grade, credit hours), and the final GPA.

This project will help you develop your programming skills and create a useful calculator for students. Feel free to explore the core concepts of the .NET language
