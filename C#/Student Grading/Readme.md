# Student Grading Application
This is a simple console application called Student Grading that automates the calculation of current grades for a class of four students. The application takes into account the students' five assignment scores and calculates their final grades based on these scores. Here's how the application works:

## Application Parameters
The application has a predefined list of four students.
- Each student has five assignment scores, each represented as an integer value ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates a perfect score.
- The final grades are determined by calculating the average of the five assignment scores for each student.
- The application performs basic mathematical operations to compute the final grades for each student.
It generates and displays the name and final grade of each student.
